# **App Name**: Haviland Archive Access

## Core Features:

- Access Code Input: A text field for entering the access code with a 'lock' icon.
- Password Visibility Toggle: An 'eye' icon that, when held, reveals the typed password in the input field.
- Vercel Blob Authentication Tool: Securely validates the entered access code against the credentials stored on a Vercel Blob storage to grant access, this validation relies on the tool to use reasonong for access level control.
- Static Site Generation: Generates a static website suitable for deployment on platforms like GitHub Pages.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Desaturated sepia (#D2B48C) to mimic aged paper. Primary Color: Desaturated burnt orange (#805533).
- Accent color: Muted gold (#B8860B) for the lock and eye icons to give a feel of historical richness.
- Font: 'Literata', a transitional serif, to emulate the look of an old document or notebook. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use simple, hand-drawn style icons for the lock and eye symbols to enhance the analog aesthetic.
- The page layout should resemble a single page from a bound notebook, with subtle textures applied to the background and input field to enhance the paper-like effect.
- Subtle animations, like a slight 'page turn' effect, could be used to enhance navigation if additional pages are implemented.
